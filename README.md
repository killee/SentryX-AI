## Overview

**SentryX AI** is a fully local, ESP32-based smart entry system for front doors.  
It combines:

- **HLK-FM22x (FM225) face recognition**
- **LD2410 mmWave radar presence detection**
- **8×8 WS2812 LED matrix** with icons, animations and greetings
- **Tight Home Assistant integration** via ESPHome API
- A small state machine that reacts to presence and face events

The goal is a **fast, privacy-friendly and hackable** access system that runs entirely on your own hardware.

## Features (Current)

### 🔍 Face Recognition (HLK-FM22x / FM225)

- Real-time face scan, triggered by radar or manual button
- Actions exposed via ESPHome API:
  - `enroll(name, direction)`
  - `scan`
  - `delete(face_id)`
  - `delete_all`
  - `reset`
  - `reset_enroll_status`
  - `show_enroll_result`
- Events forwarded to Home Assistant:
  - Face matched (with `face_id` and `name`)
  - Face unmatched
  - Invalid scan (with error code)
  - Enrollment done / failed
  - Face tracking info (yaw, pitch, roll, bounding box)
- Text sensors for scan status, enrollment status, firmware, last face name
- Visual feedback on the matrix with happy/sad faces during enrollment

---

### 📡 Radar Presence (LD2410)

- LD2410 mmWave radar connected via UART
- Presence and distance values:
  - Moving distance
  - Still distance
  - Detection distance
- Binary presence sensor (`has_target`)
- Template switch to **enable/disable radar-triggered logic**
- LD2410 buttons and numbers for:
  - Factory reset, restart, query parameters
  - Timeout, light threshold, max distance gates
  - Engineering mode and Bluetooth

The radar drives the **display state machine**:

- **0 – Blank**: nobody in range  
- **1 – Pulse**: person detected in 0.4–4 m range  
- **2 – Happy**: person very close (≤ 35 cm) → triggers face scan  
- **3 – Greeting**: “Hi <Name>” scrolls on matrix  
- **4 – Sad**: unknown face or error

---

### 🟩 LED Matrix (8×8 WS2812)

The LED matrix is driven using the `addressable_light` display platform and a set of templates:

- 8×8 WS2812 strip configured with a custom pixel mapper
- Matrix **mode** is controlled by a `select` entity:
  - Text
  - Arrow Up / Down / Left / Right
  - Smiley Happy / Sad / Wink / Wow
  - Center Dot
  - Sand Uhr (animated hourglass)
  - Tuer (animated door opening)
  - House
  - X
  - Big DOT
  - Pulse
  - Blank
- Scrollable text (`matrix_text`) with horizontal scrolling
- Matrix color and brightness controlled via the `light` entity
- Multiple animations implemented in the `lambda`:
  - Pulse ring from the center
  - Hourglass with falling sand
  - Door that opens over multiple frames

A small global state machine (`display_state` + `matrix_locked`) makes sure:

- Radar cannot overwrite a greeting (“Hi Name”) while it is active
- Unknown faces briefly show a red sad face, then return to blank
- Face enrollment directly drives happy/sad feedback

---

### 🧠 Logic / State Machine

Core logic is implemented using:

- `globals` for:
  - `matrix_locked`
  - `display_state`
  - `enroll_any_failed`
- `script`s for:
  - Triggering a face scan from LD2410
  - Showing greeting text for known faces (`matrix_show_greeting`)
  - Setting the matrix into various states (blank, pulse, happy, sad)
- `on_face_scan_*` and `on_enrollment_*` hooks on the `hlk_fm22x` component
- `on_value` for LD2410 detection distance to update display state and trigger scans

Result: The device behaves as a **self-contained frontdoor “brain”** reacting to presence and faces, and only exposes high-level entities/events to Home Assistant.

## Planned Features (Roadmap)

### 🔊 Audio & Voice (planned)

- I²S microphone (e.g. INMP441) for:
  - Knock / noise detection
  - Optional short audio snippets to HA
- I²S amplifier (e.g. MAX98357A) + sealed speaker module for:
  - Boot / error / access-granted sounds
  - Short voice prompts (“Access granted”, “Unknown visitor”)
  - Optional TTS from Home Assistant routed to SentryX AI

### 🔓 Door Unlock (planned)

- Dedicated **unlock output** (relay or MOSFET) to control:
  - Electric strike
  - Motor lock
- Configurable unlock logic in HA:
  - Face match + radar presence + time conditions
  - “Child mode” profiles
- Door status integration:
  - Lock/bolt contacts
  - Door open/closed sensor

### 🔔 Interaction & UX (planned)

- Integration with Shelly BLE buttons for local unlock triggers
- NFC/RFID option for fallback access (RC522/PN532)
- Additional matrix icons for:
  - “Do not disturb”
  - Alarm / warning
  - Call support / live view

### 📶 Smart Home / Integrations (planned)

- More detailed HA blueprints for:
  - Enrollment workflows
  - Notification flows (known/unknown visitor)
  - Audio snippet handling
- Optional multi-device setups:
  - Outside radar + inside radar
  - Shared events across multiple SentryX AI nodes

## Hardware (Reference Design)

A typical SentryX AI node consists of:

- **ESP32 DevKit** (ESP-IDF based ESPHome build)
- **HLK-FM22x / FM225** face recognition module (UART)
- **LD2410** mmWave radar (UART)
- **8×8 WS2812 LED panel** (or strip arranged as 8×8)
- Optional:
  - I²S microphone (INMP441)
  - I²S amplifier (MAX98357A)
  - 1–3 W rectangular speaker in a sealed chamber
  - Door unlock output (relay / MOSFET)
  - Door and lock contact switches

## ESPHome Configuration

The full ESPHome configuration lives in this repository, e.g.:

```text
esphome/frontdoor.yaml
```

It includes:

- Wi-Fi and OTA setup
- external_components for hlk_fm22x
- UART config for FM22x and LD2410
- Global variables and scripts for the state machine
- All sensors, switches, buttons and text/select entities
- LED matrix setup with custom pixel mapping and drawing logic

You can flash it directly via ESPHome and adapt pins/substitutions as needed.

## Home Assistant Integration

SentryX AI integrates with Home Assistant via the ESPHome native API.
